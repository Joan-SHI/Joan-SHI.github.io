    <h1>My reflection about Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>
    <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2> 
    <p>
      Shereef mentions some mindsets in this video.He compares consumer mindset(or restauraut mindset) with kitchen mindset. 
      I totally agree with him at this point that we should learn with kitchen mindset,feel respondsible for this environment,
      be hungary and inspiring.By the way, he compares soccer with tennis when he is explaining the benefits of pair programming.
      I think he means single tennis not double. Double tennis does like soccer or pair programming that needs communication
      and collaboration.
    </p>
    <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
    <p>
     I feel that EDA emphasizes teamwork a lot. "Go fast,go alone;go far,go together." And EDA's ambition is "go fast and far together"?
     I doubt it but would like to go through the whole learning process to see whether it does happen or not.
    </p>
    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
    <p>
    I am an open-minded person so I would like to soak myself up in this type of culture and see what happen to me and others.
    And because of my international background(I lived in 3 different countries before.),hope I could bring in something unique.
    </p>
    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
    <p>Haven't yet.So far so good.</p>
    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
    <p>Yes I am excited to be invovled in this kind of learning enviroment. And no it doesn't make me nervous,
    maybe because I know what I want and also I only need to compare myself at this moment with me of yesterday.
    I don't have to compare with other person. Anyhow, it is my life,my way.
