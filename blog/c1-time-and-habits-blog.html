    <h1>My reflections on time and habit techniques</h1>
    <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2> 
    <p>
      I did try Pomodoro techniques and it seems work for me. Every 25mins I have a break(5mins). 
      Then after 4 rounds(4*25mins)I have a longer break(20mins). Time seems fly quicker 
      than when I haven't tried Pomodoro techniques.
      For growth mindset, when I recalled my net volley of tennis, I did gain much
      confidence through actions(picked up more balls and returned some good shots).
    </p>
    <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
    <p>
      This saying"Confidence is just displayed ability" really hit me. And my previous experience
      tells me that it is true. If we displayed our ability,then the Confidence would come.
      I am going to use my actions to drive my mindset from now on.
    </p>
    <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
    <p>
    Pomodoro techniques and Growth mindset worked for me.
    </p>
    <h2>which will you experiment further with?</h2>
    <p>I will experiment further with Meditation and Growth Mindset. Meditation 
      seems have quite a few different types. I am keen to explore them.
