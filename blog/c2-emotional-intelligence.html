    <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2> 
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li><p>My favorite: “What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters to what lies within us.
      —Ralph Waldo Emerson”</p></li>
          <li><p>Good to know that happiness is a skill that can be trained in Matthieu's experience.</p></li>
          <li><p>Simple technique of "Labeling feelings with words" is worthy to try I think. 
    It worked and still works well when I parent my kids. But watch out, don't label feelings 
    with wrong words. </p></li>
       </ol>
      </div>

    <h2>How did you find the 2-mins of mindfulness?</h2>
      <p>I seem lose the ability of "just be" which I had when I was a kid. 
  It seems easy to get lost when busy "doing things",doesn't it? Let's shift from "doing" to "being"
  for just 2 mins then come back to the real world. It is a good way for me to refresh
  myself.
      </p>
