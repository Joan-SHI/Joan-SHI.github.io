    <h2>1. How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h2> 
      <p>Well, it did help me to overcome perfectionism, reduce my self-criticism,made me feel comfortable with
       my imperfect website. </p>
    <h2>Read or watch chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself, and reflect:</h2>
    <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
      <p>I connected meditation with Buddhism,thinking it was part of Buddhism activities.</p>
    <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
      <p>Three new things I have learnt about meditation. First,"Happiness is the default state of mind". 
        When your mind is relaxed and on alert at the same time, calmness and clarity come and lead to Happiness naturally.
        Second,Mindfulness is so powerful that it helps improve everything from attention,brain function to immunity,
        skin disease etc. Third, There are more than one postures for traditional Buddhism meditation: sitting,
        standing,walking and lying down.</p>
    <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
      <p>Definately. "Letting go" was a good one. I liked to see this book described it as not to force 
        something to go away but an invitation.</p>
    <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      <p>When I read Lao Zi's words "By non-doing, all doing becomes possible." A sentence came to me "To be is
the best way of to do". Let's say it was Joan Shi's word. By the way, Miss Mt Kaukau I am!</p>
