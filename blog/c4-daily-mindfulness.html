    <h2>What did you learn from your "mindfulness conversation"? How did the other person find it?</h2> 
    <p>Believe it or not,these 3 key components of "mindfulness conversation":</p>
    <ul>
        <em><li>Mindful listening.</li></em>
        <em><li>Looping(Closing the loop of communication).</li></em>
        <em><li>Dipping(Checking in with ourselves).</li></em>
    </ul>
<p>I have learned them since I was a kid! My parents talked to us in this way. 
And I noticed that my grandparents did the exactly same thing when talking.
It is a good family tradition to pass on, isn't it? </p>
<p>The other person found that "mindfulness conversation" could bring in the feelings
    of being supported and understood.</p>
<h2>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
</h2>
      <p>In these three techniques of:</p>
      <ul>
            <em><li>Have a buddy;</li></em>
            <em><li>Do less than you can;</li></em>
            <em><li>Take one breath a day.</li></em>
      </ul>
<p>I am going to do second and third as my starter to sustain my practice.</p>


    <h2>Any other musings? </h2>
<p>I relate these two stages of meditation progress(initial access & consolidation)
    to my learning journey in Web Development. Hope that magic day of consolidation come soon.
