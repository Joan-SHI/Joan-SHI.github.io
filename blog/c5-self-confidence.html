    <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3> 
    <p>They are essentially same thing according to the following definitions:</p>
    <p><em>"Self-awareness is a neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions."</em>By Daniel Goleman</p>
    <p><em>“Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.”</em>By Jon Kabat-Zinn</p>

<h3>Body Scan - one of the self awareness practices</h3>
<p>I did try Body Scan. I laid on my yoga mat to scan my body and felt calm and later on almost fell asleep.</p>

<h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
<p>This statement hit me:"Thoughts and emotions are not who we are; they are simply phenomena in mind and body that come and go."</p>
