    <h3>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h3> 
    <p>To be honest, there are not any triggers so far for me when programming. 
        Maybe because I set a low bar for myself during phase 0 and know that being stuck is normal.
        I know how to be friend with being stuck. Usually I will do something else 
       to switch my mind like watching a movie on Netflix,walking out of my study room to do some housework,
       gardening or feed my bunnies(they are kind of my yellow rubber ducky).</p>
    

<h3>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h3>
I did have some triggers in personal life and I used this exercise before realizing 
that it was named Siberian North Railroad exercise this week. I must have learned it from some parenting books
(I read a lot of parenting books to be a reasonable good mum).It was helpful.
