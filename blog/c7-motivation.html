    <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3> 
      <p>One interesting feature about these three lens is their varying <mark>sustainability</mark>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Life through pleasure len:This type of happiness is about always chasing the next high which 
            means it is <mark>highly unsustainable.</mark></li>
        <li>     Life through passion len:Happiness that arises from passion is much <mark>more sustainable</mark> and you are far less likely to habituate to it.</li> 
        <li>     Life through higher purpose len:This is about being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you.
            Thus, this form of happiness is very resilient and <mark>highly sustainable</mark>.</li>  
      </ul>    

    <h3>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,</h3>
      <h4>What are your core values?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I believe that us as human being should respect nature, reduce to the least of disturbing our earth(e.g.buy wisely,less is better).</li>
          <li>I believe people should be honest to themselves.</li>
          <li>I believe finding your true love is a must-to-do thing though it sounds quite a luxury stuff.</li>
          <li>I believe in maintaining a healthy work/life balance.</li>
          <li>I believe that family and friendship are of fundamental importance.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>What do you stand for?</h4>
        <p>I stand for world peace and truth and still stand even when no one else will stand with me(Prefer someone could stand with me though).</p>
       
    <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
      <p>It did mention in this chapter that we can train resilience on 3 levels: Inner calm,emotional resilience and cognitive resilience.
        I only did this type of meditation exercise once so hard to tell the result. But I love these theories. It makes me feel like no matter what a bad day you have, there is always a solution waiting for you, an inner calmness you can get access to.</p>
       
    <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      <p><mark>Higher purpose > Passion > Pleasure</mark>.</p>
