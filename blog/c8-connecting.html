    <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3> 
      <p>After I read through the whole chapter 7 of this book,
          I tried to remember when did I get the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity.
        Must be from my parents through my whole childhood. I believe that growing trust and sincerity
         will bring out the best in people which will make each other's life easier and happier.</p>

   <h3>Try <mark>empathic listening</mark> - how did it go?</h3>
     <p>I would like to place this skill on top of other mindfulness skills.It is your luck if 
        you have a friend around with this skill when you are down.With this skill, you will be your friend's treasure too.</p>

   <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
     <p>Before I learned this loving kindness meditation, Actually I have only one person on my dislike list.
    Well, after it, Zero person I dislike at this moment. And I hope this record would last for a long long long time.
     </p>

   <h3>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h3>
     <p>8 years ago we were thinking about Skilled Immigration. At that time I had been in USA for a while and later on worked in Singapore for several months. 
        I thought immigrating to NZ would be better for my personality and for my kid's future. As I was not happy with 
        the school education system which my kid would get involved in. But my friend thought otherwise.She worried about the discrimination she may have and the challenges she had to 
        take in a totally new world.Plus she felt ok with the school education system for her kid so she chose to stay. <mark>Both of us were and are right I think :)</mark></Both></p>
      
   <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
     <ul>
       <li><mark>Vulnerability-based trust</mark></li>
       <li><mark>Person praise vs Process praise</mark></li>
     </ul>
