    <h3>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3> 
    <p>When I worked in a bank, I was the mentor of new employees in my department. Usually they worked with me
         for around 1 month before they got used to the Telegraphic Transfer system and worked independently. I think I must have
         had campassionate leadership then? As we built trust and friendship and learned from each other actually.Till now some of them are still my friends.
         Here are the 3 components of compassionate leadership mentioned in this book:
         <ul>
             <li>A cognitive component:"I understand you"</li>
             <li>An affective component:"I feel for you"</li>
             <li>A motivational component:"I want to help you"</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
     <p>After I finished the multiplying goodness meditatoin, I felt like I had done it during my childhood. It must be from my mum, a very peaceful woman who
         set a good model for me. She didn't teach me the following 3 mental habits theory which mentioned in this book but she did give me the practice through the daily life.</p>  
         <ul>
             <li>Seeing goodness in self and others</li>
             <li>Giving goodness to all</li>
             <li>Confidence in the transformative power of self(that I can multiply goodness)</li>
         </ul>

   <h3>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
     <p>I did the Tonglen meditation but I couldn't see "my rays of light" breathing out.</p>

   <h3>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>
     <p>So far the SCARF model for the Social Brain is my favorite part of this book.Certainty and Autonomy apply to my Phase 0 experience.
         I don't know how it will apply to bootcamp actually.Let's see....But would like to list its key words here to remind myself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Status</li>
            <li>Certainty</li>
            <li>Autonomy</li>
            <li>Relatedness</li>
            <li>Fairness</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h3>
   <p>According to this book,there are 5 steps to conduct a difficult conversation:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Prepare by walking through the "three conversations"</li>
       <li>Decide whether to raise the issue</li>
       <li>Start from the objective "third story"</li>
       <li>Explore their story and yours</li>
       <li>Problem solve</li>
     <p>I would say I am quite good at having a difficult conversation. However I do need to
         be more careful about "whether to raise  the issue or not".
     </p>
   </ul>

   <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
   <p>"It's not the stress itself that gets to you; it's the feeling of helplessness in the face of that stress."</p>
   <p>"Happiness is a state of mind"</p>
