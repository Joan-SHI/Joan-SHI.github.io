    <h2>My wish list of CSS design and structural features</h2> 
    <div>I love VERDE MODERNA version by Dave Shea.I also found the kindly tips in the comment
        which I will follow later:
<ul><li>Use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements.</li>
<li>Use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling.</li>
        <li>Use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element.</li>
     <li>Use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI.</li>
     <li>Don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.</li>
</ul>
I am going to dissect it (or you can say cut it into different boxes.);watch how these two teammates HTML and CSS
work together and how the webpage reacts to them.

    <h2>My reflection of Udacity Lesson1</h2>

        <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?
        </h3>
        <p>You can imagine HTML as a human being body,then DOM would be the skeleton and CSS the clothes.</p>
        <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
     <p>Like wall-newspaper or newspaper pre-webpage era, people used boxes to draft the design on the whole page
     I believe. The boxifying design can give developer rough idea of webpage layout before he/she carries it out on webpage 
     using computer tools like HTML.CSS.JAVASCRIPT etc.</p>
     <h3> What is the box model?</h3>
     <p>All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. 
     The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
