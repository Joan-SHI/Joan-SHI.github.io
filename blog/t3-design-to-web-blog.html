1. What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?
A single website that adapts to any screen size so it's as easy 
to use on mobile as it is on tablet and desktop â€“ no pinching or horizontal scrolling required.
Because of increasing smartphone usage, a website needs to be user-friendly on a smartphone.

2. What mobile first design is, and why it's important?
Mobile first design means we start the product design from the mobile end which 
has more restrictions, then expand its features to create a tablet or desktop version.
The exploding of mobile use these years makes it important.

3. What frameworks are, and their pros and cons?
Frameworks are defined as packages made up of structures of files and folders of standardized code 
(HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) which can be used to support the development of websites, 
as a basis to start building a site.Their pros are: efficiency,security,low cost/free and sufficient support.
Meanwhile, the cons are: 
a You learn the framework, not the language behind it;
b You use a framework, you are forced to respect its limits and work the way it is required.
c Code is public so it may be studied by people with bad intensions to find flaws that can be used against you.

4. What a wireframe is and why we use it?
A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, 
is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. 
It helps make the design process iterative.

Add and position your wireframe images from your username.github.io/images/ directory. This will be a 'content' image, so add it as an HTML element.

5. The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why?
I found it difficult to implement my wireframes not becase of the specific aspects of them, 
but the swinging of my decision between different wireframes. It is like my clothes shopping 
style that I pick up two clothes I like and not sure which one should be brought home.
