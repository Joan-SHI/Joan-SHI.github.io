    <h2>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h2> 
    <p>The difference between them are:</p>
    <ul>
        <em><li>JavaScript is used to define the interactive elements of a webpage that help to engage users</li></em>
        <em><li>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is used to create the basic structure and content of a webpage</li></em>
        <em><li>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used for the design of a webpage – where everything is placed and how it looks</li></em>
    </ul>

    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h2>
      <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
        It is like my morning routine:<em>waking up - breakfasting - showering and brushing teeth - dressing up.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code - until a certain condition is met.
      It seems like the loop of brushing my teeth. I repeatedly every second brush the teeth until the teethbrush timer meets 2 mins and stops.</p>

    <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
  <p>Arrays use numbers to access its "elements" while objects use names to access its "members".</p>
    
    
    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>  
    <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. </p>
    <p>Functions are useful:</p>
    <ul>
        <em><li>You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times</li></em>
        <em><li>You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results</li></em>
  </ul>
