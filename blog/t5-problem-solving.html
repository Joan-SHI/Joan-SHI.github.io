      <h2>My story about problem solving</h2> 
        <ul>
          <b><li>What was the problem?</li></b>
          <p>After I wrote the function "hide" following the instructions in 5.3 Event-driven Dom modification, a double-click did make dots disappear, but not reappear with a second double-click in the same place. </p>
          <b><li>What problem solving techniques did I use?</li></b>
          <p>I then did Googling and also asked my peers for help on Slack to sort it out. </p>
          <b><li>How did you feel throughout the process?</li></b>
          <p>I felt annoyed by this simple problem thinking what a waste-time that I were doing.
            But once it was sorted out,well...trust me, that feeling was so good! You will be well paid by that thrill.</p>
          <b><li>What did you learn?</li></b>
          <p>Always keep faith that you will get there.</p>
        </ul>
      <h2>Reflect on confidence in using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>  
        <ul>
          <b><li>Pseudocode</li></b>
          <b><li>Trying something</li></b>
          <b><li>Rubber ducky method</li></b>
